RubyTask

RubyTask is a simple, command-line Ruby task manager. RubyTask is a port of a set of C++ assignments I did for a class last term.

Usage
Invoke bin/tasks to begin. Provide an optional command-line argument to specify a data file to load from and save to. The default data file is tasklist.txt in the current working directory.

Data File
Tasks are stored in a simple, plain-text data file (a format specified for my C++ assignment). Records are newline-delimited, and fields are semicolon-delimited.
